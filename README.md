Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism.[1]

The language consists of eight simple commands, which make it a nice language to implement when learning about compilers and interpreters. Which is exactly what this is.

Basic usage looks like...
```
python -m brainfuck -n fibo.bf
>> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
```
> Note: the example programs here can be found in the [examples](examples/) directory)

stdin and stdout are the default i/o streams so you can do something like this.
```
python -m brainfuck echo.bf < macbeth.txt >> shakespeare.txt
```

You can also import it as a python module.
```python
# replace the below import with `from StringIO import StringIO` for python 2.X
from io import StringIO
import brainfuck

outstream = StringIO()

with open('myprogram.bf', 'r') as f:
    brainfuck.eval(f.read(), output_stream=outstream)

outstream.seek(0)
# do something with the result
result = outstream.read()
```

Running the unit tests can be done from the project directory.
```
python -m unittest discover
```
